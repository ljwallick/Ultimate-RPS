# Ultimate-RPS
Fan-made programs inspired by fan-made variations of Rock Paper Scissors

It started with RPS_15, then I found out there was more. From RPS_7, all the way to RPS_25. Then there was RPS_101. I decided to use hte API for that one, sorry for not going all out :smiling_face_with_tear:<br>

Basically, you run the program, and it will give you a list of choices. Choose one, and the "AI" will also choose one at random. It displays whether you won or lost, who chose what, and how one beat the other (eg. paper covers rock). After that, you can choose to play again.

This was one of my fist python projects, and my fist python project series. Hope you find it fun!
